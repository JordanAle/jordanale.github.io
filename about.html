    <h2>Hi, I'm Jordan</h2>
    <p>I'm currently a master student at Cornell University studying Information Science.</p>
    <h2>Academic...ish</h2>
    <p>One of my biggest academic and personal interests rests at the intersection of digital technology and agriculture. Intergration of digital technologies in the agricultural sector can lead to not only safer working conditions, more efficient use and allocation of resources, but increased crop yield as well. With digital integration presenting these benefits, it makes sense to try to use these technologies and their underlying concepts to address concerns of people in resource scarce and underserved communities. According to a 2019 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, a lack of infrastructure, a lack of literacy (electronic and written), and political hurdles may prevent technologies as they exist in privledged, resource plentiful areas from being feasible for adoption for the communities that could most benefit from them. Thus, these technologies need to be developed with these communities' input and circumstances in mind so they too may have the option to adopt these tools. Using my educational background in computer science, data analytics and agricultural production, I hope to contribute to this area so emerging agricultural and connective technologies can serve more people, especially those that have been historically left out. </p>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>On a more personal note, I've gotten back to practicing my guitar playing after some time away from it. My hiatus has reenergized me and I'm now trying to learn the lead guitar portion of <i>So Broken</i> by Björk and tending to my small indoor garden––a beacon of hope in the Ithaca winter. Currently, I only have mint plants in the garden, but I'm planning to expand to nasturium, basil, thyme, and marigold. When the weather warms, I'll be able to tend to the plants in the community garden again.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I also enjoy trying to work out some digital solutions to applicable issues around me. For example, I live in a cooperative house with 25 other people. Everybody has chores to do and house officers need to purchase toiletries, cleaning supplies, and food for the delicious meals that we cook for the whole house. Managing these tasks amid school work, especially in the busy times of the year can be challenging and time consuming. This gave me the idea to incorporate chore completion, low supply, and food-need reporting into the app that the house already uses to communicate: GroupMe. With my application which uses the GroupMe API, housemates will be able to send a message to a house officer and the particular supply or food item they mention will be queued in a purchase order to be sent to the bulk supply and food vendors our house orders from. For the chore portion, housemates can send a message to a house officer saying they have completed their chore. The completion message will automatically update a document that officers can quickly look at to see all chorse that still need to be done along with the names of housemates to reach out to to see if they are having a difficult time with school and could use some extra support with their chores or any situations they have going on in their lives. </p>
    <p>One important area of the project lies in the affect it will have on the house dynamics. A main reason for living in a cooperative is the large amount of person-to-person interaction at home. Thus, tuning the system's scope to find a balance between saving people time and intentionally leaving some automatable tasks unaddressed to allow housemates to interact with one another is critical. I'm currently seeking feedback from my housemates and am trying to assess how the program may have an affect on the relationships between people in the house.</p>
