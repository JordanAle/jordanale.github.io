    <h2>Hi, I'm Jordan</h2>
    <p>I graduated with a Master's degree in Information Science from Cornell University and am very excited to continue putting my skill into industry action.</p>
    <h2>Industry Interests</h2>
    <p>One of my biggest industry and personal interests rests at the intersection of digital technology and agriculture. Intergration of digital technologies in the agricultural sector can lead not only to safer working conditions, and better allocation of resources, but also increased crop yield. With digital integration presenting these benefits, it makes sense to try using these technologies to address concerns of people in resource scarce and underserved communities. According to a 2019 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, a lack of infrastructure, a lack of literacy (electronic and written), and political hurdles may prevent technologies as they exist in privledged regions from being feasible for adoption in communities that could most benefit from them. Thus, these technologies need to be developed with underserved communities' input and circumstances in mind so they too may have the option to adopt these tools. Using my background in information science, data science, agricultural production and community-centered design, I want to contribute to this sector so emerging agricultural and connective technologies can serve more people, especially those traditionally left out. </p>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>On a more personal note, I've gotten back to practicing guitar after some time away from it. My hiatus reenergized me and I'm now trying to learn the lead guitar portion of <i>So Broken</i> by Björk and tending to my small indoor garden––a beacon of hope in the Ithaca winter. Currently, I only have mint plants in the garden, but I'm planning to expand to nasturium, basil, thyme, and marigold. When the weather warms, I'll be able to tend to the plants in the community garden again.</p>
